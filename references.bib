	abstract = {A new model for upward vertical subcooled flow boiling at low pressure has been proposed. The model considers the most relevant closure relationships of one-dimensional thermal-hydraulic codes that are important for accurate prediction of vapour contents in the channel: wall evaporation model, condensation model, flow regime transition criterion and drift-flux model. The new model was incorporated in the current version of the RELAP5 code, MOD3.2.2 Gamma. The modified code was validated against a number of published low-pressure subcooled boiling experiments, and in contrast to the current code, shows good agreement with experimental data. The presented analysis also leads to a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of subcooled flow boiling at low pressure.},

	abstract = {A void fraction correlation has been developed to cover the full range of pressures, flows, void fractions, and fluid types (steamwater, air-water, hydrocarbons, and oxygen). The correlation, referred to here as the Chexal-Lellouche correlation, has been qualified against several sets of steady-state two-phase/two-component flow test data that cover a wide range of thermodynamic conditions and geometries typical of PWR and BWR fuel assemblies as well as for pipes up to 450 mm in diameter. The correlation is based on a drift flux model and determines the drift flux parameters, Co and Vgj both cocurrent and countercurrent two-phase flows for the full range of pressures, flows and void fractions. The correlation is available as a source code module for inclusion into any thermal-hydraulic computer program, and as an interactive personal computer program. The correlation is continuous and does not depend on flow regime maps or spline fitting.},
