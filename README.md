# projet_ene6002
This repository contains the code and data files of a project in the course ENE6002 Two-phase flows taught at Polytechnique Montréal at semester Winter 2020.
This project has been carried out by Thomas CHARPENTIER and Gaétan RAYNAUD
It focuses on the resolution of pressure drop in heated flow using drift-flux model with two correlations. We used a classical algorithm with iterative convergence. We also presented and tested a new kind of algorithm called Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) with mitigated results.
